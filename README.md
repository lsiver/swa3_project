### An app to simulate binary distillation. Determines the minimum Reflux (Rmin) and minimum theoretical stages (Nmin) for a distillation. As well as the actual stages based on current conditions inputted.
### Uses ideal VLE conditions (Raoult's law). Some plans to expand to using non-ideal factors through Peng Robinson EOS/VLE eventually.
